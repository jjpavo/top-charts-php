Top Charts
======
Top Charts is a chart generator that allows you to create a chart of your top movies, albums, anime plot twists, fruit, etc.

It was inspired by [Topsters](https://www.neverendingchartrendering.org/ "Topsters"); I wasn't happy with the site and wanted more functionality so 
I originally was making my charts in Photoshop which quickly because tedious and unruly, leading me to creating this app!
